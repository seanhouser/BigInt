Create a data structure that can handle numbers of arbitrary length by writing a BigInteger class that supports the following basic mathematical functions:

    add
    subtract
    multiply
    divide
    modulo

by overloading existing operators for each function (+, -, *, /, %)

The class should also use overloaded >> and << operators to get input from the standard input stream (std::cin) and to write output to the standard output stream (std::cout) respectively. 

Overload comparison operators (>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=) so 2 BigInteger objects can be compared to each other
